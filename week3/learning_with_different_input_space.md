###concrete features:
each dimension of X \\(\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\\) represents `sophisticated physical learning`
資料是具體的，使用人類的專業知識選出有意義的輸入資料。

###raw features:
simple physical meaning,thus more difficult for ML than concrete features.

often need human or machines to `convert to concrete ones`

###abstract features:
no physical meaning,thus even more difficult for ML

again need `feature conversion`/extraction/construction
如果你只有抽象的features,你就需要人類或機器去找出有意義的feature
